# Peyto Lake - SDDM Theme

This is a simple SDDM theme based on [Breeze by David Edmundson](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/tree/master/sddm-theme), featuring the iconic Peyto Lake located in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada.
Basically it's just Breeze enhanced with a bit of Canadiana.
